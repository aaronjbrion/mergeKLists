# mergeKLists

In this program, I created a class called KLists with four functions. The four functions are mergeKLists, merge, arrayOutput, and the main. The mergeKLists takes in a 2d array and if the array has a length of 0, it returns an array of 0. The function loops through the array and calls the next merge function and then returns that variable. The merge function takes in two arrays when it is called which is called left and right. The merge function has 3 values set to 0, each array's length is set equal to a variable and a new double array with both lengths added up is instantiated. There is a while loop that keeps going when the values are less than the length of the arrays that are going in. If the left array is less than or equal to the right side, the left array gets incremented and vice versa and then returns a result. Then there is also a print method which prints an open bracket, the new sorted array, and then a closed bracket. The main function then has four arrays declared and is then used in the merge and print functions to sort them in order into one array.
